Hi! I'm Rodrigo Garc√≠a-Tejera. 

I'm interested in diverse topic ranging from complex biological systems, stem cell biology to statistical physics, nonlinear physics and complex networks.  

I'm currently doing a PhD in regenerative medicine at the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/regenerative-medicine/research/linus-schumacher), specifically proposing and studying stochastic models of stem cell populations that include different regulatory mechanisms. We seek to better understand the signatures that different regulation strategies leave on the stem cell population dynaimcs, and learn how to distinguish their presence or absence from experimental data. 

I find this venture pretty exciting, since it allows me to combine mathematical and computational tools I'm interested in, like analytical solutions to chemical master equations or doing stochastic simulations, to understand core questions in stem cell biology. You can find some of our work in [this article](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspa.2022.0376), and its corresponding [repository](https://github.com/RodrigoGarciaTejera/vBD_simulations) (I still have to add descriptions and user manuals) with Matlab code for doing stuff like running stochastic simulations and doing the system-size expansion to the chemical master equation up to an arbitrary order. Also check out [this repository](https://github.com/RodrigoGarciaTejera/SpermStem) from a project under development, where we look at the role of stem cell heterogeneity in spermatogenesis.   

I am also interested in physics education. [This](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06949) is our latest submitted article on how to use the smartphone as a portable laboratory for studying experimentally coupled oscillations. The corresponding repository with Python code for data analysis and simulations can be found [here](https://github.com/RodrigoGarciaTejera/WilberforcePendulum). 

In the past I have done research in [experimental chaos](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0960077913000672) , [synchronization of nonlinear oscillators](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epjst/e2014-02295-6) , and my MSc thesis was on [network inference in neural systems](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-59198-7). My interest in these topics remains intact.     

If you'd like to get in touch just drop me a message at rodrigo.garcia@ed.ac.uk, or on twitter @RGarciaTejera. 

Cheers! 

<!---     , where we propose a model (vBD) that describes stem cell dynamics when they are competing for access to a limited space, and we solve analytically its corresponding chemical master equation. The corresponding [repository](..RodrigoGarciaTejera/vBD_simulations) has Matlab code with a class designed to deal with the chemical reaction network, calculating hitting times, doing stochastic simulations, etc., and another class to deal with the system-size expansion.          -->
