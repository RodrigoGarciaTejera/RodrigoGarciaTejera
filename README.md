Hi! I'm Rodrigo García-Tejera. 

I'm interested in topics ranging from complex biological systems, stem cell biology to statistical physics, nonlinear physics and complex networks.  

### Stochastic models of stem cell populations

I'm currently doing a PhD in regenerative medicine at the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/regenerative-medicine/research/linus-schumacher), specifically proposing and studying stochastic models of stem cell populations that include different regulatory mechanisms. We seek to better understand the signatures of different regulation strategies on the stem cell population dynaimcs, and learn how to distinguish their presence or absence from experimental data. 

I find this venture pretty exciting, since it allows me to combine mathematical and computational tools I'm interested in, like analytical solutions to chemical master equations or stochastic simulations, to approach core questions in stem cell biology. You can find some of our work in [this article](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspa.2022.0376) and [this repository](https://github.com/RodrigoGarciaTejera/vBD_simulations).

We are currently using stochastic modelling to explore the role of stem cell heterogeneity in spermatogenesis, I'll be dropping resources for that in [this repository](https://github.com/RodrigoGarciaTejera/SpermStem). 

### Other topics
Physics education - [This](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06949) is our latest submitted article on how to use smartphones as  portable laboratories for studying coupled oscillations. Find Python code for data analysis and simulations [here](https://github.com/RodrigoGarciaTejera/WilberforcePendulum).

<!---     , where we propose a model (vBD) that describes stem cell dynamics when they are competing for access to a limited space, and we solve analytically its corresponding chemical master equation. The corresponding [repository](..RodrigoGarciaTejera/vBD_simulations) has Matlab code with a class designed to deal with the chemical reaction network, calculating hitting times, doing stochastic simulations, etc., and another class to deal with the system-size expansion.          -->
